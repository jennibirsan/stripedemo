# Stripe Payments Demo â€” Node Server

This directory contains the main Node implementation of the payments server using Stripe for the project: The Storehouse Chicago.

### About


### Main Project

The main project is The Storehouse Chicago.

- Github: https://github.com/daveyjonezz/theStorehouseChicago.git
- Heroku: https://thestorehousechitown.herokuapp.com/ 

The Stripe integration is its own seperate deployment that connects via API to the Storehouse Chicago. They run on two seperate servers. This integration functions after you click the cart button on the main project.

### Credits

I used the following Stripe Demo as my boiler plate for The Storehouse Chicago:
