# Stripe Payments Demo

This directory contains the main Node implementation of the payments server using Stripe for the project: The Storehouse Chicago.

### Main Project

The main project is The Storehouse Chicago.

- Github: https://github.com/daveyjonezz/theStorehouseChicago.git
- Heroku: https://thestorehousechitown.herokuapp.com/ 
- Stripe Heroku: 

The Stripe integration is its own seperate deployment that connects via API to the Storehouse Chicago. They run on two seperate servers. This integration functions after you click the cart button on the main project.

### About

- To Test: Enter all shipping/billing information or you can click "generate" at the top to place a random address. For the credit card, enter Stripe's test card number (4242 4242 4242 4242) and a future expiration data and a random 3 digit cvv code. Once you click "Pay", it will confirm your order and submit it to the back end of Stripe. Please see screenshots below.
